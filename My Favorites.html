<p> In terms of content creators that inspires me, there has been two that always comes to mind. Mori Calliope and Suisei Hoshimachi from Hololive. Mori Calliope has been a big inspiration for me, her songs has been a big part of my life ever since she debuted.
And Suisei's story of being an indie vtuber, and being accepted into a big company like Hololive, it left a big impression on me.</p>
