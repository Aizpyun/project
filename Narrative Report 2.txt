For the second week of the project making, me and the group decided to brainstorm regarding the different things we had to record. We talked about different scenarios that could be used in the script, as well as different things we had to bring for the recording, and how we would go about the recording. 

We ultimately decided on recording different scenes on different venues. Primarily some taken outside, and some taken inside our respective houses. And we talked about how it would be edited, and what the flow of the different scenes would be.
