            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>I am Anthony Lorenzo D. Capua, I am currently a student at Cavite State University, in the course Computer Science. 
                I wish to pursue this course because I want to be able to make games that can help brighten up other people's day.
                
                I was born on November 7, 2002 in the city of Imus. I was the 4th and last son of my mother and father, Melinda Capua and Antonio Capua. 
                I was exposed to art at a very young age, and the art style I've been shooting for has always been "Anime", because it is something I truly enjoyed with my brothers and parents. Anime has always been a big part of my life growing up. 
                And thus, it has influenced me greatly, even forming the basis of my artstyle. 
                I studied at one school for majority of my life, Our Lady of the Pillar Catholic School Inc. 
                It has been my school for both my primary and secondary education.
